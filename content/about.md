Hello, this is Jim, a computer scientist from Germany ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my page!
I am interested in machine learning, data science, darts, Japanese and personal growth.

Besides having this site as a "business card," I am using it to document my side projects. 
I do this to practice my technical writing skills. Some blog posts serve as archives to recall unrecorded or rare information from a technical field.
If you have comments, suggestions, or detect any security issues, please send me an email <ðŸ˜Š>.
